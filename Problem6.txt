Problem 6:

****create a hive meta store database named problem6 and import all tables from mysql retail_db database into hive meta store
****On spark shell use data available on meta store as source and perform step 3,4,5 and 6. [this proves your ability to use meta store as a source] 

**** Rank products within department by price and order by department ascending and rank descending 
		[this proves you can produce ranked and sorted data on joined data sets]
